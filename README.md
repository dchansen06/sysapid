# sysapid
Delivers compact JSON information so that you can integrate it into your local web apps

It is highly recommended to fork and modify the program to deliver the information you want. Installing out of box is possible but will not be super useful.

The syntax in the files is fairly straightforward, just add any new commands or other lines as you would expect. Make sure that all relevant binaries are installed as needed.

You may need to install [sensors(1)](https://linux.die.net/man/1/sensors) https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SensorInstallHowto if that is your preferred method of collecting temperature data.

Note: As of now I do not know of any reliable method to get temperature data on Windows.
